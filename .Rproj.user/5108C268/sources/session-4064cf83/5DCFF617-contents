```
Basic statistics
```{r, warning=FALSE}
library(tidyverse)
library(DT)
summary_data <- summary(data)
summary_df <- as.data.frame(t(summary_data))
datatable(summary_df, 
          options = list(pageLength = 7, autoWidth = TRUE), rownames = FALSE )
```
The data does not contain any anomalous or unrealistic values, ensuring the integrity of the dataset. Credit_risk has its mean value at 0.02893. That means that in our data only around 3% of people are categorise as high risk so we need to focus especially on that small group.

```{r}
library(corrplot)
correlation_matrix <- cor(data[, sapply(data, is.numeric)])
corrplot(correlation_matrix, method = "circle", tl.pos = "n" )
```
At first it seems like credit risk isn't significantly correlated to any of our predictors, but we will test it.
We see strong positive and negative correlations between some predictors, but for now it doesn't scares us because we can use random forest which is resistant to autocorrelation of predictors.
